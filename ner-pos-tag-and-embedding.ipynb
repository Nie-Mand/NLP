It first constructs a large matrix of (words x context) co-occurrence information, i.e. for each “word” (the rows), you count how frequently we see this word in some “context” (the columns) in a large corpus. The number of “contexts” is of course large, since it is essentially combinatorial in size. So then we factorize this matrix to yield a lower-dimensional (word x features) matrix, where each row now yields a vector representation for each word.
